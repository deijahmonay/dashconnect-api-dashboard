# JavaScript API Dashboard

This is a project I built to practice working with public APIs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each section on the dashboard pulls data from a different API and displays it dynamically. It’s a simple, interactive way to learn how to make API requests, handle responses, and update the DOM.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure and layout
- **CSS** – styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – logic and API integration
- **Fetch API** – for making asynchronous requests
- **Bootstrap 5** – grid system, responsive utilities, and CSS
- **Async/Await** – cleaner handling of asynchronous code

## 💡 Project Features

Each section is powered by a different public API:

### 🎬 Movie Info
- API: [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
- Enter a movie title to get posters and release years

### 🐱 Random Cat Fact
- API: https://catfact.ninja/fact
- Returns a random cat fact once user clicks button

### 📜 English to Shakespeare
- API: https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/shakespeare.json
- Translates text into Shakespearean English

### 🔗 QR Code Generator
- API: https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code
- Converts any URL into a QR code

### 🎱 Magic GIF Ball (Yes/No)
- API: https://yesno.wtf/api
- Ask a yes/no question and get a response with a GIF

### 🤣 Random Joke
- API: https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming
- Shows a random programming joke, something special for fellow Devs

### 😅 Excuse Generator
- API: https://excuser-three.vercel.app/v1/excuse/3
- Generates three random excuses once user clicks button

### 📚 Useless Facts
- API: https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/api/v2/facts/random?language=en
- Returns a random, not-helpful fact

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Fork / Clone starter code
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Interact with any section to test the API features

No installation or setup is needed — it’s fully front-end.

## 📌 Goals

This project helped me:
- Get more comfortable using `fetch()` and `async/await`
- Understand how to work with different types of API responses
- Practice organizing code for multiple interactive components
- Build confidence using JavaScript to update the DOM
